# MerchantKit
A modern In-App Purchases management framework for iOS developers.

MerchantKit dramatically simplifies the work indie developers have to do in order to add premium monetizable components to their applications.

MerchantKit handles retrieving purchases, tracking purchased products, watching for renewal and expiration of subscriptions, restoring transactions, validating iTunes Store receipts, and more. 

MerchantKit is designed for apps that have a finite set of purchasable products (although it is flexible enough to work with other types of apps too). For example, MerchantKit is a great way to add an unlockable 'pro tier' to an application, as a one-time purchase or ongoing subscription.

## Example Snippets

Find out if a product has been purchased:

```swift
let product = merchant.product(withIdentifier "iap.productidentifier")
print("isPurchased", merchant.state(for: product).isPurchased)
```

Buy a product:

```swift
let task = merchant.commitPurchaseTask(for: purchase)
task.onCompletion = { result in 
    switch result {
        case .succeeded(_):
            print("purchase completed")
        case .failed(let error):
            print("\(error)")
    }
}
task.start()
```

Get notified when a subscription expires:

```swift
public func merchant(_ merchant: Merchant, didChangeStatesFor products: Set<Product>) {
    if let subscriptionProduct = products.first(where: { $0.identifier == "subscription.protier") }) {
        let state = merchant.state(for: subscriptionProduct)
        
        switch state {
            case .isSubscribed(let expiryDate):
                print("subscribed, expires \(expiryDate)")
            default:
                print("subscription expired")
        }
    }
}
```

## Project Goals

- Straightforward, concise, API to support non-consumable, consumable and subscription In-App Purchases.
- No external dependencies beyond Foundation and StoreKit.
- Prioritise developer convenience and accessibility over security. MerchantKit should support secure anti-piracy methods where possible without compromising developer ease-of-use.
- Do-whatever-you-want open source license.
- Compatibility with latest Swift version using idiomatic language constructs.

The codebase is in flux right now. MerchantKit is by no means finished and there are major components that are in the project's scope but completely unimplemented (consumable products are not supported). The test suite is currently bare.

## Getting Started

1. Compile the MerchantKit framework and embed it in your application. In your app delegate, import `MerchantKit` create a `Merchant` instance in `application(_:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`. Supply a storage object (recommended: `KeychainPurchaseStorage`) and a delegate.
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    self.merchant = Merchant(storage: KeychainPurchaseStorage(serviceName: "AppName"), delegate: self)    
    ...
}
```

2. Implement the two required methods in `MerchantDelegate` to validate receipt data and receive notifications when the `PurchasedState` changes for registered products.
```swift
func merchant(_ merchant: Merchant, didChangeStatesFor products: Set<Product>) {
    for product in products {
        print("updated \(product)")
    }
 }
    
func merchant(_ merchant: Merchant, validate receiptData: Data, completion: @escaping (Result<Receipt>) -> Void) {
    let validator = ServerReceiptValidator(receiptData: receiptData, sharedSecret: "iTunesStoreSharedSecretGoesHere")
    validator.onCompletion = { result in
        completion(result)
    }
        
    validator.start()
}
```
3. Register products as soon as possible (typically within `application(_:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`). You may want to load these products from a resource file. The included `LocalConfiguration` object provides a mechanism for this.
```swift
let config = try! MerchantKit.LocalConfiguration(fromResourceNamed: "MerchantConfig", extension: "plist")
self.merchant.register(config.products)

```
4. Call `setup()` on the merchant instance before escaping the `application(_:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method. This tells the merchant to start observing the payment queue.`
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    self.merchant = Merchant(storage: KeychainPurchaseStorage(serviceName: "AppName"), delegate: self)    
    self.merchant.register(...)
    ...
    self.merchant.setup()
    ...
}
```
5. Profit! Or something.

## To Be Completed (in no particular order)

- Add tests to the bare test suite. MerchantKit components can be tested separately, including the validators and `PurchaseStorage` types.
- Add a validator for In-App Purchase data that does not depend on network requests. This requires parsing the ASN resource from the local bundle. The tricky part is implementing this without relying on external dependencies. Help would be appreciated in this area.
- Implement consumable purchases somehow. This will likely involve a special delegate callback to tell the application to update its quantities.
- Extend the API of `PriceFormatter` to be a comprehensive formatter for product prices. This includes adding ways to express subscription periods (eg: 'Â£3.99 per month').
- Probably a lot more stuff I haven't thought of yet.
